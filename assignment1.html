					Proposal
				</h1>
				
				<hr>My proposal is to redesign the website for the coffee shop that I work at. The site was made seven years ago and the shop was recently sold to new owners, who i now work for, the site is in need of a redesign. I have brought this idea to my current employeer and they said it would be ok to draft them up a website. I don't, at this point, plan to fully implement this into their systems but thought the idea intresting. I would like to make 
			this site based off a real domain that i am familier with.

			<div id="Audience">
				<h1>Audience</h1>
					<ol>					
						<li>Customers (Coffe drinkers and locals) come looking for information about the shop and giftcards. They generally want to see the menu, order gift cards, find the location, and occasionaly ask about updates.</li>
						<li>New Owners of Brighouse coffee and cafe seek a new website to put their brand on.</li>
					</ol>
			</div>
			<div id="Content"> <!--Marks the content of the actual assignment-->
				<h1>Content</h1>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Icons</b> - I will have social media icons link to their respective sites such as insta, twitter, and facebook</li>					
						<li><b>Menu</b> - The Menu page will be accessed from a heading bar, along with other tabs. The menu page will contain info similar to the already created menu on the Bridgehous website, but will be reformated with a more modern aperance.</li>
						<li><b>Gift cards</b> - Gift cards are a common item for the shop and are frequently asked about. This Page would seek to answer the most frequently asked questions. It would also serve to give customers a means to purchase a gift card.</li>
						<li><b>News/ Events</b> - The Menu often times gets updated or an event happens down town. This Page would act to present comming events and changes. Currently social media is the main source for spreading news but the current site lacks updates to current happenings.</li>
						<li><b>About</b> - A simple tab/ page for information about the owners and shop its self. essentially a bio for the shop.</li>
						<li><b>Location</b> - A simple section in one of the previously mentioned tabs that will display google maps location. Other informantion would also be provided based of location.</li>
